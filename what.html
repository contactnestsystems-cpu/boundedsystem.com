  <h1>What NEST Is</h1>
  <p>
    NEST is a technology framework designed for building safe, predictable autonomous systems. 
    It is based on deterministic control principles rather than probabilistic models. Each NEST system 
    module has a fully specified behavior in advance, eliminating randomness or learning-based changes 
    at run time.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using static, rule-based design, NEST ensures that all operations remain within known bounds. 
    The architecture is modular, so any malfunction in one component is contained and cannot cascade 
    through the system. Unlike adaptive AI, NEST does not require training data or model updates to operate.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deterministic:</strong> Behavior is fully determined by design, with no random or learned elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounded:</strong> Outputs and states stay within predefined safe limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Modular:</strong> System components are isolated to prevent fault propagation.</li>
    <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> No hidden state means the system can be exhaustively tested and certified.</li>
  </ul>
