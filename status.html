  <h1>Scientific Status</h1>
  <p>
    NEST is grounded in well-established principles from control theory and formal methods. 
    It is currently under active research and development. Initial prototypes have been tested 
    in simulated environments, demonstrating that deterministic constraints effectively 
    prevent unbounded behavior even in edge cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ongoing work involves rigorous evaluation and verification. The core concepts are being 
    studied by our team and collaborators, with plans to publish findings in upcoming 
    peer-reviewed venues. NEST's approach is novel but builds on decades of engineering 
    experience in certified systems.
